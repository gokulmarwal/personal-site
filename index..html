        <h3>Design & Developer</h3>
        <p>“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.Being a
          web developer is always difficult. It’s a creative job, but one where usually you aren’t the primary stakeholder.
          I know how it feels to use your creative juices to perfect a piece of code, only to have someone else ask for a
          sudden change in a different direction.
          So many web developers can relate to that experience.
          I’m sure you know how it feels, too.

          Here are some quotes that might help you feel better.</p>

        <h3>Python coder</h3>
        <p>A good Python web developer has incredible honing over either of the
          two web frameworks Django or Flask or both. Django is a high-level Python Web Framework that encourages a good,
          clean and pragmatic design and Flask is also widely used
          Python micro web framework. Sound knowledge of Front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is also
          expected.</p>
